# Contributing to ODE Explorer

Hello and welcome to the ODE Explorer! I started this hobby project in the second half of 2020. My goal is to create a user-friendly, fun little mathematics library for exploring the wide mathematical field of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which is also where the name comes from.

My main motivations for this project were my interest in numerical analysis and differential equations, and also my desire to improve as a software engineer.

This library is not optimized for pure compute speed (though efforts might shift towards that in the future), but rather for repeatability and tracking of numerical experiments. Most of the features were written with that in mind as well. As I come across new cool technologies, I might to integrate them in some form into this project. Recommendations are always welcome!

If you are using this library and like it, you are most welcome to contribute if you want - that is the point of this file. Got a cool idea for a feature that you wish were there, but it's not? Feel free to create a pull request, or send me a message on my email nicho.junge@gmail.com. Found a bad bug that ruins the flow? Let me know by creating an issue. Do you have general feedback about the library, e.g. what is good and what can be improved? Please send me a message as well - your feedback and criticism are the most valuable aspects for facilitating improvements.

A small heads up: This is "just" a hobby project - and thus, things like my work or personal life take precedence over it. Hence, although I try to keep delays to a minimum, issues / pull requests might be processed with some delay.

If you made it this far - thanks for reading and for visiting this project. Have a great day!

This is the ode-explorer Python package,
a small library designed for solving, fast prototyping and visualization
of systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).


# Installation

After obtaining this repository, for example by ``git clone``ing it,
navigate to the folder and run ``pip install`` on it:

```
## making / activating a virtual environment in the first place
## example here uses virtualenvwrapper

mkvirtualenv odeexplorer
git clone https://github.com/njunge94/ode-explorer.git
cd ode-explorer
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```

It is very much advised to do this inside of a virtual environment to avoid bloating your 
system's own Python installation. A popular option for working with virtual environments is 
[virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is also used in the installation example above.


# Introduction and first steps

## Models

Many processes in nature like radioactive decay, chemical reactions or classical mechanics can be characterized by **ordinary differential equations (ODEs).** Solving these equations for a process then directly gives a prediction of its evolution.

The number of equations that actually have closed form solutions available is actually a small minority; hence, numerical methods need to be developed to simulate more complex processes with correspondingly complex equations.

An ordinary differential equation is usually written in literature as
```
y' = f(t, y),
```

where ``f(t,y)`` is called the *model*. Based on that intuition, ode-explorer exposes the ``ODEModel`` class, which is a small wrapper around a standard Python callable with signature

```
f(t: float, y: float or np.ndarray, **kwargs)
```
where you can add special parameters for your model like reaction constants, decay rates etc. via Python's kwargs paradigm.

## Integrators and step functions

Solving ordinary differential equations in the computer happens by numerical integration. A popular method of solving ODEs are the *single-step methods*, which also encompass Runge-Kutta methods among others.

ode-explorer handles numerical integration by exposing an *Integrator* object. It has some internal state that facilitates logging among other things, and exposes two main integration APIs, 
``integrate_const`` and ``integrate_dynamically``. The former can be used to integrate an ODE using a fixed step size h, while the latter can be equipped with a step size controlling mechanism,
which chooses a step size based on local error estimates. For more information, check out the [textbook by Hairer, Wanner and NÃ¸rsett](https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783540566700).

**Step functions** are used to advance models in time during numerical integration. These methods usually differ in computational complexity and order of consistency; as a rule of thumb, a more accurate solution requires more computational work (as one might expect).

ode-explorer provides a ``StepFunction`` Interface that is built exactly for this purpose. Adding your own step functions is very simple - it requires only one of the following:
1. Subclass the ``StepFunction`` base class and override its ``forward`` method to calculate the estimate.
2. Initialize one of the template classes in ``ode_explorer.templates`` with your chosen arguments.

Since most step functions originate from families of methods (e.g. explicit/implicit RK methods, linear multistep methods), they can be templated rather well - templates for some of the most common step function families are given in ``ode_explorer.templates``. 

[BEWARE]: As of 21/11/20, templates have been untested, so use at your own discretion (or fall back to the builtin methods for the moment) :-)

## Callbacks and metrics

The main strong point / value of this library is that you can heavily customize your experiments to your liking. Two of the main instruments for this are callbacks and metrics.

*Callbacks* are designed to hook into the control flow of the numerical integration; ode-explorer exposes a ``Callback`` interface which is basically a callable with state. 
This concept may be familiar to users of ML libraries of scikit-learn and Tensorflow, which were the main inspiration behind this.
You can do many things with callbacks, like logging, broadcasting your solver's intermittent results via websocket, check for NaN values - this is where your creativity comes in!

The same applies to *metrics* (with the corresponding ``Metric`` interface), which are also callables that can be used to compute quantities of interest after each step.
Possible use cases include distance to a known ODE solution for sanity checking a step function, logging accepted and rejected steps in a step size control setting, or tracking of a first integral in a Hamiltonian system -
again, the possibilities are really vast, so try it out!

## Step size control

Step size control is something like an art form - you can use the built-in ``StepSizeController`` interface to build your own. 


# Demos [WIP]

Check out the ``demo`` folder for some demonstrations of the package - most of them are quick and easy Jupyter Notebook examples. More will be gradually added - if you have a suggestion or you want to contribute your own, feel free to send me a message!

To install Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab, run the following inside of your created virtual environment:
```
pip install notebook    ## <---- for Jupyter Notebook
pip install jupyterlab  ## <---- for Jupyter Lab
```
# Testing [WIP]

Any numerical software should be tested extensively - not just for exception safety, but also for making sure it produces quality results. Testing is still very much a work in progress, but will be added gradually.

# Planned features [WIP]

Some more feature plans that are in the mix for this library (again, feel free to request more features):

* Hamiltonian Systems
* Visualizations, Dashboard
* GPU support with JAX / XLA
* More builtin callbacks / metrics
* Boundary value problems (BVPs)
* Differential-Algebraic Equations (DAEs)
* Run caching / re-use, warm starting
